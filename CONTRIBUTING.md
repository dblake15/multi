# Contributing

## Getting started

If you would like to contribute, please refer to the following guidelines/instructions:

1. First, clone the repository by navigating to whichever parent directory you want Launch to live under and running `git clone https://github.com/sredna43/launch.git .` which will clone the repository into a folder named Launch. At this point, you are good to go!

2. Once you have made the changes that you want, and think that they are something that everyone ought to have access to, create a pull request!

3. Always follow the [Code of Conduct](/CONDUCT.md), thanks!
